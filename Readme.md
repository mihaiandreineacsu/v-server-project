# V-Server Setup

This is a documentation of setting up ssh login using SSH-Key Pairs, configure Nginx web server to access an alternative Web Page and configure Git on V-Server.

The setup was performed on host machine Windows 11 using Powershell Terminal and remote machine Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-105-generic x86_64).

Along reading this Documentation, you will come across many examples that contain wrapped expressions like for example `<some_expressions>`, that means the content wrapped, in this case `<some_expressions>` should be replaced with your own content.

## SSH Login

### To configure a ssh login with ssh-key pairs follow this steps

```powershell
# On host machine generate a ssh-key pairs.
ssh-keygen -t ed25519

# Provide a name for the ssh-key files:
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (~/.ssh/id_ed25519):  ~/.ssh/<ssh_key_name>

# Provide no input for the passphrase
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:

# After that the output of generating ssh-key pairs should look like this.
Your identification has been saved in <ssh_key_name>
Your public key has been saved in <ssh_key_name>.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:<some_hashed_generated_value> <hostmachine_username@hostmachine_name>
The key''s randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|             o.oo|
|            + +  |
|           o X . |
|          . B + o|
|        S  + = = |
|         .*.o.O. |
|         o+*.o.Bo|
|         .++o =+*|
|         E+o..+Bo|
+----[SHA256]-----+

# Add the public ssh-key to your v-server using the Powershell command:
Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\<ssh_key_name>.pub | ssh <user>@<remoteserver> "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"

# Test your ssh login using ssh-key:
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<ssh_key> <user>@<remoteserver>
```

### Deactivate ssh password login

> [!Note]
> One of the basic SSH hardening step is to disable password based SSH login. You know that you can use ssh with the root or other accountâ€™s password to login remotely into a Linux server. But this poses a security risk because a huge numbers of bots are always trying to login to your system with random passwords. This is called brute force attack.

---

> [!WARNING]
> First make sure you configured and testet ssh login using ssh-key works, then follow this steps:

```bash
# Connect to your v-server using your provided username and password:
ssh <user>@<remoteserver>

# Open the sshd configuration file to write to:
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Search for "PasswordAuthentication"
# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
PasswordAuthentication no
# Save the changes and close the editor

# Restart ssh service:
sudo systemctl restart ssh

# To logout from your v-server just run in terminal:
logout

# Try reconnect via password:
ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no <username>@<remoteserver>

# For successful deactivated PasswordAuthentication the output should look something like this:
<user>@<remoteserver>: Permission denied (publickey).

```

### Setup a SSH-Config for more identities on your host machine, for an easer ssh-login

```powershell
# Navigate to ssh folder on your host machine
cd ~/.ssh

# There should be a file named "config". If there is none, create one.
# Append it this content:
Host <remoteserver>
    User <user>
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<ssh_key_name>
# Save the changes.

# With this configuration you can run this command to login to your v-server:
ssh <remoteserver>
```

> [!NOTE]
> "Bad owner or permissions" error may happen on Windows when you run `ssh <remoteserver>` . To Fix it follow this steps:

```powershell
# Navigate to the .ssh directory:
cd <path_to>\.ssh

# Check the current permissions of your <ssh_config_file>:
Get-Acl .\<ssh_config_file> | Format-List

# Remove the problematic permissions:
$acl = Get-Acl .\<ssh_config_file>
    $acl.Access | Where-Object { $_.IdentityReference -match "Authenticated Users" } | ForEach-Object {
        $acl.RemoveAccessRule($_)
    }
    Set-Acl .\<ssh_config_file> $acl

# Ensure only the user has permissions:
icacls .\<shh_config_file> /inheritance:r
icacls .\<shh_config_file> /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):(F)"
```

## Nginx Alternative Web Page

### Log into your v-server, and first update the packages by running this command

```bash
# A prompt may pop asking you to select some services that need to be restarted after the update.
# Just selected some and moved on.
sudo apt update
```

### After the update install nginx by running following commands

```bash
# The "-y" means to answer automatically "yes" on all input prompts that come along installation process.
sudo apt install nginx -y

#  After installation finishes you can run this command to check if nginx is up and running. :
sudo systemctl status nginx

# If nginx is up and running, you should now have a web server that anyone can access via web browser just by given your external IP address in there browser.
# For now nginx will show a default page.
# This default page can be found in "/var/www/html/" and by default is usually named "index.nginx-debian.html".
# And the default nginx configuration file that serves this "html" via browser connection is by default in "/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default".
# This file also contains interesting information about nginx that you may wanna check it out.
```

>[!TIP]
> You can generally use ```sudo systemctl <on_service_operation> <service_name>``` command to check the status with ```status``` , stop and start with ```restart```, stop with ```stop``` or start with ```start``` a service on your v-server.

### Add your own web page

```bash
# Created a directory were your web page file that you wanna server via web server should be. Example:
sudo mkdir /var/www/alternatives
# With ```mkdir``` you can create directories in your server.

# Then create the file itself. Example:
sudo touch /var/www/alternatives/alternate-index.html
# With ```touch``` you can create files in your server.

# Open the file to write it content. Example:
sudo nano /var/www/alternatives/alternate-index.html
```

```html
<!-- Then give it this content: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Alternative</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, Nginx!</h1>
    <p>I just configured our Nginx web server on Ubuntu Server!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Add your own nginx configuration

```bash
# Create your own nginx configuration file. Example:
sudo touch /etc/ngninx/sites-enabled/alternatives
```

```nginx
# Then give it this content:
server {
    # This directive tells Nginx to listen on port <port> for IPv4 connections.
    listen <port>;

    # This directive tells Nginx to listen on port <port> for IPv6 connections.
    listen [::]:<port>;

    # This is your created folder, all files inside this folder will be served via nginx
    root /var/www/alternatives;

    # This is your created file, a default file to be server via nginx if no files was requested
    index alternate-index.html;

    # Basically gives a Not Found Response to requester if no such requested file has been found
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

 ```bash
 # Checked your nginx configuration for errors by running:
 nginx -t

 # Last, restarte nginx service.
 sudo systemctl restart nginx
 ```

Now if you access your `<remoteserver>` via the browser, you will not see your own page, but the default page of nginx. To see your page you have to access your `<remoteserver>:<port>` via the browser. Port is what you gave it in your nginx configuration.

## Git configuration

### Install and configure git on your v-server

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git

# After you installed git you need to configure it. That means only setting the git's global configuration user:
git config --global user.name "<your_name>"
git config --global user.email "<your_email>"
```

### Generate SSH-Key Pairs for Github

Basically almost the same as you did in [SSH Login](#ssh-login), but following Github Documentation.

```bash
# Generate SSH-Key Pairs, but this time on your v-server:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your_email>"
# >[!Note]: here give your Github Account email for <your_email>

# Starte the ssh-agent in the background:
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    Agent pid 20664

#  Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/<ssh_key_file_name>
    Identity added: /path_to/.ssh/<ssh_key_file_name> (your_email)

# Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.
cat ~/.ssh/<ssh_key_file_name>.pub
```

### Paste the SSH Public Key into your Github Account settings

- In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
- In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  SSH and GPG keys.
Click New SSH key or Add SSH key.
- In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example, if you're using a personal laptop, you might call this key "Personal laptop".
- Select the type of key, either authentication or signing. For more information about commit signing, see "About commit signature verification."
- In the "Key" field, paste your public key.
Click Add SSH key.
